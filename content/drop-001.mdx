# Drop #001 — The House Opens

This is the first Drop.

## What it is
A culture house with a business engine and an owned IP universe — built with intention.

## Why it matters
This is the baseline. A system that protects trust, keeps the voice clean, and lets creativity stay raw without getting sloppy.

## What’s next
More drops, tools, experiments, and collaborations — each with a dedicated page that can be shared and indexed.
